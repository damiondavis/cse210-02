# Hilo
The rules are simple. The dealer draws a card between 1 and 13 and you must decide if the next card is going to be higher or lower then the previous card. 
You start the game with 300 points and you gain 100 points when you guess correctly and loose 75 points when you guess incorrectly. If your score reaches zero then it is Game Over. 
See how long you can last!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 hilo 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
