from game.hilo import Hilo
"""
This section of code will have the bulk of the hilo game code in it. It will take the user input, pick the random card, update the score, 
and control the output of the score.

ENH: I have renamed the file and class (Dealer) to be align to the Hilo Specifications https://byui-cse.github.io/cse210-course-competency/abstraction/materials/hilo-specification.html
